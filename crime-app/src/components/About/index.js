            This project was created in order to show data related to property
            crime in the United States in an easier format than what the FBI
            database provides to users. The crime discussed in this project
            will be based on the top three most common property crimes that
            occur in the United States. These crimes include larceny, burglary
            and motor vehicle theft respectively.
