# MEJO 583 Spring 2019 Final Project

This seed repo will be updated with configuration changes as needed until the project is due.


#Data Prep & Cleaning 
Data obtained from Foreign Service Institute in 03/2019.
Data groups languages into categories of difficulty for Native English speakers.

##Prep
Data was manually cleaned to be in CSV format with headers.

Edited categories to be numerical values instead of strings; edited titles to eliminate word "language" and to read "moderate" instead of "Category II" and "advanced" instead of "super-hard".

Converted data from .csv to .json format.
