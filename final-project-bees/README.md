# MEJO 583 Spring 2019 Final Project

This seed repo will be updated with configuration changes as needed until the project is due.

# BEGAN PROJECT
Started building a framework for the story based on scroll magic. Integrated my design + images and created it with html & css grid

# CREATED REACT APP 
React App was created after this due to a misunderstanding. I began building separate components for each story "section" and copying the original index + css information over into the react components. 

# CLEANED AND ORGANIZED DATA 
Data found from the USDA at https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/rn301137d/jq085n95f/mc87pt22m/BeeColonies-08-01-2018.pdf. Data had to be manually extracted and cleaned as charts were in .txt format. 

# USED HIGHCHARTS TO CREATE DATA
Manually entered data into highcharts component 

# INSTALLED FLIPPY 
Installed flippy via npm and worked with it to create a "flip-card" effect

# CREATED A COLOPHON 
Created a colophon footer for reference and sources
